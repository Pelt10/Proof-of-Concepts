# Proof of Concepts
This directory is not a project by itself. Just some code I want to keep and that I wrote to test ideas, debug or to learn.

## About Issues
Issues have been disabled on this project. The reason is that these aren't projects we are looking to maintain. They are simple proof of concepts we wanted to share with the community.
